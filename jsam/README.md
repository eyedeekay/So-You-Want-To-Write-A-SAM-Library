Jsam
----

Jsam is basically a port of goSam to to something like a Java Socket. There may
well be much better ways of talking to SAM with Java, but goSam's construction
is very easy to understand so I chose to do it in this way. The version in this
folder will deviate from the version presented in the tutorial, which has been
deliberately presented in a simple way. It expects implementers to figure out
how to do language-specific things on their own, which is in fact part of why I
decided to write it(I need to get the hang of Java again).

It has a number of obvious shortcomings at this time.
